# Heynote Documentation

[Changelog](/docs/changelog/)

Heynote is a dedicated scratchpad for developers. It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc. 

The Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.

Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Custom Key Bindings

Heynote supports custom key bindings which you can configure in the settings. The key bindings are evaluated from top to bottom, so a binding that comes before another one will take precedence. Most commands will stop the event from propagating, but some commands only applies in certain contexts and might not stop the event from propagating to a later key binding. 

To disable one of the built in key bindings, you can add a new key binding with the same key combination for the command "Do nothing". This will stop the event from propagating to the built in key binding.

## Download/Installation

Download the appropriate (Mac, Windows or Linux) version from [heynote.com](https://heynote.com). The Windows build is not signed, so you might see some scary warning (I can not justify paying a yearly fee for a certificate just to get rid of that).

If installing Heynote on Linux in ChromeOS, see the [notes](#user-content-linux-on-chromeos) below about some packages that are needed.

On macOS, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) users can utilize an unofficial [Homebrew Cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/heynote#default): `brew install --cask heynote`

## Math Blocks

Heynote's Math blocks are powered by [Math.js expressions](https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions). Checkout their [documentation](https://mathjs.org/docs/) to see what [syntax](https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/syntax.html), [functions](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html), and [constants](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/constants.html) are available.

### Accessing the previous result

The variable `prev` can be used to access the previous result. For example:

```
128
prev * 2 # 256
```

### Changing how the results of Math blocks are formatted

You can define a custom `format` function within the Math block like this:

```
_format = format # store reference to the built in format
format(x) = _format(x, {notation:"exponential"})
```

You can also do something like this to show the number with your default locale or provide a [custom one](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/):

```
format(x) = x.toLocaleString();
format(x) = x.toLocaleString('en-GB');
```

See the [Math.js format()](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions/format.html) function for more info on what's supported.


## The notes library

The notes library is a directory (with sub dirs) on the disk with a `.txt` file for each buffer. It's created the first time you start Heynote, with the default buffer file `scratch.txt` in it. The default location for the library is:

-   Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Heynote/notes/`
-   Windows: `%APPDATA%\Heynote\notes\`
-   Linux: `~/.config/Heynote/notes/`

You can change the path of the notes library in the settings. Heynote expects reasonably fast disk access to the notes library, so it's not recommended to use a network drive, though file syncing services like Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. should work (see below).

### Synchronizing the notes library

Heynote is built to support synchronizing the notes library (or buffer file in the case of Heynote 1.x) through file-syncing services like Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. However, note that the synchronization logic is quite simple, so editing the same buffer on two different machines at the same time might lead to conflicts and unexpected results.

When using a file synching service that support "offloading" of files in the cloud (removing them from the disk), it's recommended to mark the notes library as "always available offline".

As always, backup things that are important.


## Linux

### Linux on ChromeOS

It's been reported [(#48)](https://github.com/heyman/heynote/issues/48) that ChromeOS's Debian VM need the following packages installed to run the Heynote AppImage:

```
libfuse2
libnss3
libnspr4
```

### Wayland

Due to [an issue in Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/38288), the global hotkey will not work in all applications running under Wayland. In KDE it is possible to work around this limitation by adding this Kwin script:

```javascript
function toggleHeynote() {
  var client = workspace.clientList().find((c) => c.resourceClass.toLowerCase() === 'heynote');
  if (client) {
    if (client.minimized) {
      client.minimized = false;
      workspace.activeClient = client;
    } else {
      if (workspace.activeClient == client) {
        client.minimized = true;
      } else {
        workspace.activeClient = client;
      }
    }
  }
}
registerShortcut('toggleHeynote', 'Toggle Heynote', 'Ctrl+Shift+H', toggleHeynote);
```

See the [KWin scripting tutorial](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/kwin/) for instructions on how to install the script.

Remember to enable the script in the KDE System Settings. It may also be necessary to go into the KDE System Settings and bind the "Toggle Heynote" key manually.
