# Changelog

Here are the most notable changes in each release. For a more detailed list of changes, see the [Github Releases page](https://github.com/heyman/heynote/releases).

## 2.5.0 (not yet released)

### Tabs

You now get a visual representation of open buffers in the form of tabs. The tabs are integrated in the menu bar to take up as little screen real estate as possible, and they can also be turned off - completely or just in fullscreen mode - in the settings. 

### Other fixes and improvements

- Remember the open buffer(s) between program restarts
- Fixed so that Alt-clicking on an cursor removes it (if more than one cursor exists)
- Changed the key binding for rectangular selection from Alt+Click to Alt+Shift+Click.
- Update to latest version of Electron


## 2.4.0

### Improved  search functionality

The new search (and replace) dialog has an improved UI and is now "block aware", meaning that one can choose to search within the current block or across all blocks. The search settings (within the current block, case sensitivity, whole words) also affects the `Cmd/Ctrl-D` command for selecting the next occurrence of the current selection.

### Other fixes and improvements

- Fix issues with todo lists checkboxes in Markdown blocks
- Fix issue with markdown blocks sometimes not being fully folded

## 2.3.3

- Prevent blocks from unfolding when changing the block language
- Fix issue toggling the fold gutter setting

## 2.3.2

- Improve folding to be less aggressive with the unfolding (e.g. when creating a new block after a folded block, and then immediately pressing backspace to remove the new block)

## 2.3.1

- Fix issue with the cursor being a few pixels too short
- Fix issue where one could remove characters within a folded block without it getting unfolded

## 2.3.0

### Improved support for folding blocks

- Fixed an issue where some types of blocks could not be folded. 
- The fold state is now stored in the buffer file so that it's persisted between sessions. 
- Added three new commands for folding and unfolding blocks:
  - `foldBlock` - Folds the current/selected block(s). Default key binding is `Ctrl-Alt-[` on Windows/Linux and `Cmd-Option-[` on Mac.
  - `unfoldBlock` - Unfolds the current/selected block(s). Default key binding is `Ctrl-Alt-]` on Windows/Linux and `Cmd-Option-]` on Mac.
  - `toggleFoldBlock` - Toggles the fold state of the current/selected block. Default key binding is `Ctrl-Alt-.` on Windows/Linux and `Cmd-Option-.` on Mac.
- Folded blocks now display the first 50 characters of the block content, as well as the number of lines in the block.
- Default key bindings for folding code on Mac changed from `Cmd-Option-[` and `Cmd-Option-]` to `Cmd-Shift-[` and `Cmd-Shift-]` (to avoid conflicts with the new block folding commands)

### Other features and fixes

- Add document navigation commands (Ctrl+Home/End)
- Fix wrong positioning if IME interface (for Chinese input)
- Prevent editor from loosing focus when line number/fold gutter is clicked

## 2.2.2

- Fix issue when changing settings after having upgraded to Heynote 2.2 from an earlier version

## 2.2.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fix issue where the second command in the command palette, instead of the first command, was selected when the palette is opened.
- Change name/label of some commands in the command palette, and make commands searchable using their key names as well.
- Fix key bindings for toggleComment and toggleBlockComment commands that were previously working.
- Fix issue with lists in markdown blocks not automatically being continued when pressing enter.


## 2.2.0

### New Features

- Added support for custom key bindings. See [the documentation](https://heynote.com/docs/#user-content-custom-key-bindings) for more info.
- Added a "command palette" that can be accessed by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`, or just typing `>` in the buffer selector. The command palette allows you to discover all available commands in the app, and to quickly execute them.
- Added support for configuring the tab size, as well as the option to use tabs instead of spaces for indentation.
- Added functionality for moving blocks up and down. Default key bindings are `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+Shift+Up` and `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+Shift+Down`.
- Added functionality for inserting the current date and time. Default key binding is `Alt+Shift+D`.

### Other changes

- Upgraded to latest version of Electron, CodeMirror, Vue, electron-builder and other dependencies.

## 2.1.4

- Fix issue with positioning and size of todo list checkboxes in Markdown blocks when using a non-default font size, or a non-monospaced font.
- Fix issue when pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+A` in a text input inside a modal dialog (e.g. the buffer selector). Previously the select all command would be sent to the editor.

## 2.1.3

- Fix escaping issue in buffer selector (properly this time, hopefully)

## 2.1.2 (yanked)

- Fix issue where buffer name wasn't properly escaped in buffer selector

## 2.1.1

- Fix bug on Windows causing sub directories in the note library to not work correctly

## 2.1.0

### New Features

- Added support for moving the current block to another (or new) buffer. Pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+S` will now pop up a dialog where you can search for and select another buffer to which the block will be moved. It's also possible to select to create a new buffer to which the block will be moved.
- Add right click context menu with undo/redo/cut/copy/paste/select all as well as Delete Block and Move block to another buffer.
- Add File menu item for switching buffer
- When deleting a block, the cursor will now end up at the beginning of the next block, instead of at the end of the previous block.
- Added support for the following languages:
  * Elixir
  * Scala
- PHP blocks no longer requires `<?php` for syntax highlighting to work

### Bug Fixes

- MacOS: Clicking the Heynote icon in the dock when using menu bar mode didn't bring up the window
- Redo from the application menu didn't work


## 2.0.0

### IMPORTANT (breaking change)

The default path of the scratch file has changed. The first time you start the new version of Heynote, your existing buffer file will be migrated to the new note library. If you're using the default buffer location, that means that the existing Scratch buffer file will be moved from `%APP_DIR%/buffer.txt` to `%APP_DIR%/notes/scratch.txt`. If you are using a custom buffer location the existing scratch file will be moved from `%CUSTOM_DIR%/buffer.txt` to `%CUSTOM_DIR%/scratch.txt`. Before the migration, the existing buffer file will be backed up to `%APP_DIR%/buffer.txt.bak` or `%CUSTOM_DIR%/buffer.txt.bak`.

If you are running a previous version of Heynote with the buffer file synchronized across multiple machines using a file synching service such as Dropbox or OneDrive, you should make sure to upgrade all machines to Heynote 2.0 at the same time (closing Heynote before) in order for the file to stay in sync, since the file path for the buffer file has changed. 

### Support for multiple note buffers. 

Apart from the default Scratch buffer, you can now create and switch between multiple note buffers. `Ctrl/Cmd+N` opens up a dialog for creating a new buffer. By pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+S` you can create a new note from the current block (the current block will be moved into the new note). New note buffers are saved to the note library which is basically a directory (with sub dirs) on the disk with a `.txt` file for each buffer. You switch between buffers by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+P`.

### Other changes

- The file format for the buffer files has been updated to include some JSON metadata at the top of the file. 
- The cursor(s) location is saved between sessions.
- Improvements when using a file syncing service (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive) to sync the note library between machines.
- The setting for changing the color theme is now located in the program settings, instead of in the status bar.
- Improvements to the language selector's search feature (it's now possible to search for languages by their file extension).

## 1.6.0

- Added support for having Heynote in the Mac Menu Bar / Tray icon
- Ability to specify file system location of Heynote's buffer file. The buffer will automatically be reloaded if changed on disk, so this should make it possible to have the buffer automatically synced between machines using a file-syncing service such as Dropbox.
- Custom font and font size support.

- Syntax hightlighting support for new languages:
  * Swift
  * Kotlin
