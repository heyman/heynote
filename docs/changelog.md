# Changelog

Here are the most notable changes in each release. For a more detailed list of changes, see the [Github Releases page](https://github.com/heyman/heynote/releases).

## 2.1.4 (not released yet)

- Fix issue with positioning and size of todo list checkboxes in Markdown blocks when using a non-default font size, or a non-monospaced font.
- Fix issue when pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+A` in a text input inside a modal dialog (e.g. the buffer selector). Previously the select all command would be sent to the editor.

## 2.1.3

- Fix escaping issue in buffer selector (properly this time, hopefully)

## 2.1.2 (yanked)

- Fix issue where buffer name wasn't properly escaped in buffer selector

## 2.1.1

- Fix bug on Windows causing sub directories in the note library to not work correctly

## 2.1.0

### New Features

- Added support for moving the current block to another (or new) buffer. Pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+S` will now pop up a dialog where you can search for and select another buffer to which the block will be moved. It's also possible to select to create a new buffer to which the block will be moved.
- Add right click context menu with undo/redo/cut/copy/paste/select all as well as Delete Block and Move block to another buffer.
- Add File menu item for switching buffer
- When deleting a block, the cursor will now end up at the beginning of the next block, instead of at the end of the previous block.
- Added support for the following languages:
  * Elixir
  * Scala
- PHP blocks no longer requires `<?php` for syntax highlighting to work

### Bug Fixes

- MacOS: Clicking the Heynote icon in the dock when using menu bar mode didn't bring up the window
- Redo from the application menu didn't work


## 2.0.0

### IMPORTANT (breaking change)

The default path of the scratch file has changed. The first time you start the new version of Heynote, your existing buffer file will be migrated to the new note library. If you're using the default buffer location, that means that the existing Scratch buffer file will be moved from `%APP_DIR%/buffer.txt` to `%APP_DIR%/notes/scratch.txt`. If you are using a custom buffer location the existing scratch file will be moved from `%CUSTOM_DIR%/buffer.txt` to `%CUSTOM_DIR%/scratch.txt`. Before the migration, the existing buffer file will be backed up to `%APP_DIR%/buffer.txt.bak` or `%CUSTOM_DIR%/buffer.txt.bak`.

If you are running a previous version of Heynote with the buffer file synchronized across multiple machines using a file synching service such as Dropbox or OneDrive, you should make sure to upgrade all machines to Heynote 2.0 at the same time (closing Heynote before) in order for the file to stay in sync, since the file path for the buffer file has changed. 

### Support for multiple note buffers. 

Apart from the default Scratch buffer, you can now create and switch between multiple note buffers. `Ctrl/Cmd+N` opens up a dialog for creating a new buffer. By pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+S` you can create a new note from the current block (the current block will be moved into the new note). New note buffers are saved to the note library which is basically a directory (with sub dirs) on the disk with a `.txt` file for each buffer. You switch between buffers by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+P`.

### Other changes

- The file format for the buffer files has been updated to include some JSON metadata at the top of the file. 
- The cursor(s) location is saved between sessions.
- Improvements when using a file syncing service (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive) to sync the note library between machines.
- The setting for changing the color theme is now located in the program settings, instead of in the status bar.
- Improvements to the language selector's search feature (it's now possible to search for languages by their file extension).

## 1.6.0

- Added support for having Heynote in the Mac Menu Bar / Tray icon

- There's now a Heynote webapp at [app.heynote.com](https://app.heynote.com). It's still work-in-progress, but should be usable. The buffer is stored in localStorage.
