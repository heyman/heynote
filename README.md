# Heynote

[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/heyman/heynote)](https://github.com/heyman/heynote/releases)


Heynote is a dedicated scratchpad for developers. It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc. 

The Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.

Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Installation

Download the appropriate (Mac, Windows or Linux) version from the latest Github release (or from [heynote.com](https://heynote.com)). The Windows build is not signed, so you might see some scary warning (I can not justify paying a yearly fee for a certificate just to get rid of that).

## Development

To develop Heynote you need Node.js and you should (hopefully) just need to check out the code and then run:

```
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

### Contributions

I'm happy to merge contributions that fit my vision for the app. Bug fixes are always welcome.
